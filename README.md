This repo contains my webassembly stuff, intended for use with ldc.

arsd-webassembly is the library code, including partial source ports
of some libraries I use and a minimal druntime for use on the web.
You should compile with these modules instead of the real libraries.

server is a little web server and the other bridge code in javascript
and html. Of course you don't need to use my webserver.

This is EXTREMELY MINIMAL. I only wrote what I needed for my demo. Your
use cases will probably not work.
